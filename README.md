Campaign dashboard

This build is a fully responsive Campaign Dashboard built with Next JS
Deployment Link: [`Campaign Dashboard live-demo`](https://nupat-dashboard.vercel.app/)

Tools Used
1. Next JS
2. TypeScript
3. Tailwind CSS



## Code Structure
From the figma design, I categorized its elements into 3 major components i.e the Sidebar, the Header, & the Main content component. The page was a flex layout in a row direction between the sidebar and the parent container to the Header & Main content component. The Main component from the figma design consisted of several cards which is a single dynamic component that can accept props such as the card title, the slider width, and the slider color.


## Challenges
```bash
- Passing tailwind styles as props to the reusable component.
- Screen Layout
```


## Gains
```bash
- Practical use of resusable components and dynamic props.
- Using typed definitions with TypeScript reduced development bugs.
- User-friendly Tailwind CSS utility classes.
- Learnt how to implement darkMode.
```
